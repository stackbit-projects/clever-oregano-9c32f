      I'm a 20 year-old Computer Science Bachelor's student. I'm currently
      living and studying in Brazil and my pronouns are she/her. I'm an
      enthusiast for women in STE(A)M, learning foreign languages and reading
      about design.


      I volunteer mainly in two local women empowering projects: Meninas
      Digitais PiauÃ­ and Girl Up (Campus Club for UFPI). Through these projects,
      I'm developing my (web/interface) design and leadership skills: I've
      helped to publish the MDPI website and I'm the founder of the Campus Club.
      I've been awarded for essay writing twice on high school (equivalent): in
      the first time, I wrote about traffic education (focusing on the
      consequences of drunk driving), and for the second, I've commented briefly
      about homophobia. 


      I've been chosen to the 2020 (consequently, 2021) Youth fellowship of the
      Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (CGI.br), to represent the country
      at the LACIGF and to watch the Brazilian Internet Forum, with both trips
      all-paid... after the pandemic. During the selection, I've been asked to
      write from the Brazilian laws on Internet and data to feminist issues that
      have something to do with it.


      As a Computer Science student, I've also been into government-funded
      laboratory research, at my university's Artificial Intelligence lab.
      Although brief, this experience taught me a lot of lessons, and helped me
      choose a path in technology: UX/UI design and media studies in general. In
      the moment, I'm focused on learning what I can to land my first official
      job on the area. I plan on using my multidisciplinary experience to
      fulfill my goals.


      As for foreign languages, I've been learning Portuguese obviously since I
      was at my mom's womb, as a Brazilian girl and English since I was actually
      born, because she is an English teacher, full-time. At middle school, I
      started learning Spanish as a subject (soon my interest grew and I started
      to learn outside of the classroom) and, at college, before the pandemic
      hit, I started learning French in a public language school. My main goals
      at the moment are to reach proficiency in both English and Spanish, score
      well on the TOEFL test (maybe I'll take IELTS too) and improve my French
      as well as I can.


      I'm interested in reading about Art since high school, but Design only
      caught my eye when I entered college and saw my first programming
      subjects. I wanted to give up immediately so as a form of motivation, I
      sought online my career possibilities if I graduated and found out about
      Digital Media courses that have a little bit of programming and overall
      felt interesting. I turned these courses into my postgrad goals (as I've
      always dreamt with the titles I could get, as the daughter of two
      teachers) and since then, I've been reading more and more about it and
      working on an eclectic portfolio.


      I've created this blog to write about random things I learn and think that
      are interesting. Hope you like it as well.
